# Sufang Campaign 2023 | Session Notes

by Dron and the DM

## Session 0 (20230303): PvP and Pickpockets

Aldris Duskwalker (Mashi/half-elf Lunar Sorcerer), Elstaer Kevmorn (Half-Teytal-half-Mashi/half-elf Necromancy Wizard) and Thors the Troll (Goliath Oath of Paladin Redemption) meet on the way to Yanamri and things don't start off that well. Elstaer insults paladins, Thors attacks him as Aldris tries to distance himself from the commotion.

However, two Quicklings pop out of the forest and take some of their gold. Thors knocks Elstaer out and takes his money. One runs towards Yanamri and one knocks out Thors.

A mythical spirit, identified by Aldris as a _Ke-Riin_ emerges from the forest, and destroys the quickling, heals Elstaer and Thors, and magically instructs them, "**don't fight!**".

Arnaut Kepler (Efari/half-elf Swashbuckler Rogue), near the Eastern Gate in Yanamri, spots the quickling rush past the guards and enter the city, he hides by some trees and spreads bearings on the ground to trip the quickling.
The quickling, disrupted by the bearings, stops for a moment as a guard throws a spear at him. Arnaut then slays it.

As the guard approaches him, Arnaut thanks him for helping him get his gold back. The guard, Imino who just saw the quickling enter the city and can see the half-elf (Aldris) running after it, doesn't buy it. Arnaut then _reveals_ to him that he is a forest ranger (changing his _Cloak of Many Fashions_ to a more ranger-y pattern). Imino accepts this and asks him to help him with the quickling corpse.

Imino tells Arnaut how some Fae creatures have been causing some trouble in the city, that the miners might go on strike and he thinks that both of them are related.

As Aldris reaches the gate, they discuss how to re-distribute the gold. When Thors and Elstaer reach the gate, Thors tries to tell the guards that he used to be a pirate. As Arnaut and Thors start to argue, then patch-up and start dancing, the other on-duty guard, Akkso, pushes everyone inside the city.

Arnaut looks into Elstaer's eyes and sees that this guy has seen **_some shit_**.

## Session 1 (20230318): Caught Red Handed

The party finds themselves in a narrow street between the city guard barracks building and the city walls. The party heads to Bull's Beak Tavern, with Arnaut as their guide.

They arrive and get drinks. Thors gets a sad-looking miner a Bull's Beak Ale. Arnaut overhears a conversation amongst a couple of city guardsmen about a strike. He comes back, asks the miner some questions while getting him even more drunk.

The miner says his friend _Etawr_ got pushed by some blurry thing, and exploded in blood seconds later. Thors promises to help, and the miner then passes out. _WHAT SHALL WE DO WITH A DRUNKEN SAILOR EARLIE IN THE MORNIN'?_ Another barkeep helps _Meitris_ (the miner) and gets him a room, Elstaer also retires to a room he gets.

Bart, the owner of the tavern calls Arnaut to the side and asks for help. He tells him to bring some protection with him. He then asks Aldris and Thors to come along.

Bart leads them to a small shack which has blood and symbols all over the place, and a red right hand that's pinned to the wall by a rapier. Bart tells them to investigate. Aldris realizes one of the symbols is _Blood Magic_ but cannot recognize the rest. Arnaut finds a note in Efari that says "The sword is yours to take, Reckoner". He also finds that the blade is magical upon his touch, and the hand belongs to a Tiefling. Thors uses Divine Sense and realizes the Blood Magic is evil, and the mirror is also the most evil thing in the room. He sees a reflection of himself with red eyes, and breaks the mirror. They leave, leaving Dari the Dwarf to clean up the mess and notify Bart that Arnaut took the hand in case he pops by while Dari is there.

The party visits _Mitsa's Magic Shop_, where they meet a gnome wizard name Snifarflerobin.

<!-- ![[snifarflerobin.jpg|snifarflerobin]] -->

He tells them that the sword is magical (not blood magic) and has a lock inside it, that the sigil they found was a Conjuration/Abjuration/Transmutation sigil, probably used to transport something/someone.

Aldris reveals himself to be born during the Night of the Blood Moon, Snifarlflerobin tells him that he was the previous _Chosen of the Moon_ and hands him his first spellcasting focus, naming Aldris his successor.

Arnaut tells Snifarflerobin what they found, and Snifarflerobin recreates an illusion of the room. As Arnaut sees the symbols again, he realizes that it's Thieves' Cant and tells everyone that it reads: "Keep it safe, don't let them take it. Temei is important." The last bit seems to trigger a realisation in Aldris. He also reveals that the hand is indeed Kaz's (old spellcaster teammate of Arnaut and Thors), and that Kaz is no longer on the material plane.

He then goes on about how Fate is a bitch and she'll kill him if he helps too much.

Thors asks him about his eyes glowing in the reflection and SInfarflerobin lists three possibilities: - Thors was drunk - The evil in the mirror was reflecting his divine sense - There is a monster hunting him as some monsters (especially those created by Blood Magic) like to taunt their prey before killing them

With that, the party departs. Arnaut buys a lemon for 1 CP as they head for the tavern to recount what happened to Elstaer.

## Session 2 (20230613): Tum Mujhe Haath Do, Mai Tumhe Armour Dunga

-   Talk with Xaber (Dwarven Armorer)
-   Xaber is the best NPC, he is my guy he is my fam he is my lord
-   Get Studded Leather Armor (45 gp, tomorrow evening) and Splint Armor (170 gp + 5 hands in armor, day after tomorrow evening), will tell us if the Quicklings try to sell him shit.
-   Head back to Bull's Beak, the popos are here and the doors are locked
-   Arnaut speaks w/ them, recognizes Imino and Akkso, they ask him to spy on the miners who are inside discussing a strike
-   Party heads back to the tavern, Arnaut does chinta-ta-chita-chita to open the door and meets Akshay Kumar inside
-   Tells them that Bart (the owner) went to speak to the guards, but he hasn't returned.
-   Popos want Arnaut to open the door, Arnaut doesn't, Aldris does but Thors and Arnaut convince him otherwise.
-   Thors comes up to examine the miner. He's bleeding and appears to be afflicted by something.
-   Uses Lay on Hands to fight the infection but something is resisting him. He realizes it's something to do with the blood of the miner's friend which got on him, clears the room, and uses Divine Sense.
-   There's a CREATURE inside the guy and it's like completely pure evil, and as Thors figures out the outline, it knows Thors is looking at it.
-   Aldris mingles with the miners, they ask where he's from, then ask for his help but make it clear not to betray them.
-   They need help regarding some blood magic symbols down in the mines where 18 miners died. Only 7 were reported, the remaining 11 had blood magic on them and weren't reported because town is like "ey no blood magic ma I will send red tag anna"
-   They want Aldris to identify the stuff and bring Thors along (but Aldris is the contact and so he is responsible).
-   Arnaut approaches with free drinks (cheapest ones) and politely tells them to fuck off before the popos enter.
-   They ask Arnaut to join their expedition. Arnaut agrees and leads them to the back door where they have a tunnel. They ask him about Bart but he stays neutral.
-   With the miners gone, they rearrange all the equipment and Arnaut then goes to open the door, but there's a voice... "DAYA DARWAZA TOD!" (kidding)
