## 20220809

-   On the way to Phandalen
    -   We see the town
    -   There are ruins around the new buildings (the town used to be bigger)
    -   Sildar is much more relaxed
-   We go to 'StoneHill Inn':
    -   There is a human innkeeper, Trilena (Erxhalim has slept with her before).
    -   She has a husband named Toblin.
    -   Erxhalim gets a drink
    -   We all go to our rooms
-   The next day, we overhear:
    -   An old dwarf farmer called Narth, a gossipy half-elf barmaid called Elsa.
    -   Erxhalim tries to flirt with her
    -   There is tiefling bard, Chorus, playing music
    -   Narth is talking about:
        -   Sister gara-el (oversees the shrine of luck) recently left town for a few days, when she returned, she had a scar and was exhausted
    -   Elsa tells us about the town:
        -   Daran Edermath, an orchard keeper is a former adventurer
        -   Try to stay clear of the red brands (a gang which controls Phandalen and extorts people, led by a mysterious figure known as Glass Taff)
    -   A miner, Lanar says:
        -   Did you hear that at the east end of the Tribor trail, there were some orc raiders
    -   James Silgod, a gnomish prospector says:
        -   There were goblins on tribor trail attacking trading parties
        -   He'd pay 10 gold pieces whoever will kill them
    -   He was supposed to find him
-   Talking to Trilena:
    -   Thel dendrar, the local woodcarver stood up to the red brands, they beat him up and he is bed ridden.
    -   The others took his stuff and kidnapped his family
-   The redbrands frequent the 'sleeping giant' taphouse
-   A kid says another kid found a secret tunnel but the red brands caught him.
-   The red brands do every bussines except mining cause they don't want trouble with Halia Faunten. She is the leader of the miner's exchange.
-   Sildar says he will help with the red brands if we help him with Iarno
-   We head to the Edermath orchard:
    -   We see a fit (;)), silver-haired half-elf with an ornamental sword tending to the orchards
    -   HerbAxe takes 4 peaches and 4 apples, goes to the top of the tree and surveys the area
-   We go to his cottege:
    -   He was in 'the order of the gauntlet'
    -   The order fights against the assassin's guild (Erxhalim's group)
    -   We tell him why we need our help
    -   He already knows sildar
    -   He sent them some fruit and knows that their secret base is in Tresendar Manor
    -   He tells us that many prospectors were chased by undead near old owl's well and someone is digging around there (dangerous magic could be around)
    -   The ruins are of an ancient magical empire
    -   Halia runs the miner's guild, isn't someone you want to watch your back (you need to promise her that there's a reward and she won't let you go)
-   We go to give the cart's goods to the destination (barthen's):
    -   Barthen and Gundren were trying to find the 'Lost Mines of Phandelver'
    -   More than 500 years ago, dwarves and gnomes made an agreement (Phandelver's pact)
    -   They would gain access to a mine (wave echo cave), with great wealth and magical power
    -   Human spellcaster used that energy to create the 'Forge of Spells', where magic items can be created
    -   This made Phandalen rich, but then Orc attacked and the cave was lost
    -   We then Barthen about what happened to Gundren

    -   Erxhalim successfully asks the girl at the shop out!
    -   The party buys some adventuring gear.

-   We head to The Miner's Exchange:
    -   There are two people dressed in red, outside the building
    -   He says the boss says no one can meet Halia
    -   These are the red bandits:
-   We turn around and head to Tresendar manner
    -   We see the sleeping giant taphouse
    -   I try to go in, Ebira stops me, the commotion causes some red brands to come out
-   We fight
-   We kill 3, one surrenders
-   We wrap him in Nagina and take him aside to interrogate him.
