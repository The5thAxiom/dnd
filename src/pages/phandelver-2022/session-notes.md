-   The path splits, Erxhalim goes straight ahead, HerbAxe and Ebira go on the fork, where there is a barking dog.
-   Erxhalim:
    -   There is a bridge and shit.
    -   He stealth kills a goblin (morbius) and he falls in the stream and there is a splash but no one finds out.
    -   He goes ahead, through some passages.
    -   He finds Sildar, bound. The goblins appear to wanting to be eating him. The goblin boss is also there.
    -   He one-shots the goblin boss. The others know he's there.
-   The others:
    -   Find a small chamber, smelling of dirty fir. There are three chained wolves. I calm all of them, unchain one and he goes away.
    -   We follow a draft of wind, towards where boblin says his boss is but can't climb.
    -   We trace our steps, find Erxhalim's tracks. We hear a cry of surprise.
    -   We see Erxhalim who just shot an arrow.
