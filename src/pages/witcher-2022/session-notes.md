    -   We learn that teafling only live in fairbank villiage
    -   Irven's daughter liked how the vials glowed.
    -   Arcana check on vials:
        -   not natural
        -   magical aura
        -   no idea about the type of magic
        -   Elro asked many quacks (religious healers) and none of their spells worked on the vials
    -   We take two vials and keep them in Nimrod's alms box.
    -   Okami is good at feeding bats to the toads.
    -   Eseld tries to feed Dhaniya a bat, but Dhaniya doesn't like it.
    -   Okami uses axie to make him eat it. Quartzite throws a bat at Okami.
    -   We roll initiative:

        -   Eregon
        -   Nimrod
        -   Regular Frog
        -   Old Croaker
        -   Quartzite
        -   Dhaniya
        -   Eseld
    -   Okami runs out of the cave, the frogs calm down.
    -   Everyone leaves, Okami is outside
-   We make Okami pay 5gp for elven (actual) parle G, Dhaniya likes him.
-   We tell Elro everything, he takes the vials to study them and asks us to wait till the morning.
-   I ask a Gnome lady to hook me up with a collar for my doggie.
-   We eat and go sleep (long rest).


# 20220723 | Session 5

- @ the Tavern:
    - Eseld's vision:
        - sees a mountain
        - orange light behind the mountain
        - there is a humming noise
        - it gets louder and he wakes up
    - Elro is paying for it all
    - Xeru, another witcher was also asked by Elro to help him
    - The Gnomish tavern keeper gives me a collar and a leash
    - I put the leash in the bag
    - Okami thinks the collar is kinky (for some FUCKING reason)
    - Xeru meets the party
    - Nimrod doesn't like being surrounded by witchers (nimrod ke 2 aage witcher, nimrod ke 2 peeche witcher, aage witcher, peeche witcher, bolo kitne witcher?)
    - Elro rushes in, approaches us and talks to us:
        - Before the war and the conjuction, an old witcher came to Elro to ask about the Iselkross ruins
        - but the witcher had to go and help his student (vesemir (okami is looking for him))
        - Back then, Iselkross was under a glacier.
        - during the conjunction, there was a bright orange glow
        - they thought monsters were gonna appear but the didn't
        - Recently, Urgon found out that the glacier had melted
        - then Urgon went to Iselkross on his own and got artefacts
        - Iselkross used to be an elven militiary research bunker
        - there had been an accident in Iselkross and no one heard from it
        - thus, the vials were military research, prolly something called 'Frigid Woe'
        - it can't be detected, removed or anything using a spell
        - they prolly had a cure (probably still in Iselkross)
        - Elro takes a vial and puts it over a flame, the contents turn black
        - the spores' weakness is Fire!
    - what we need to do:
        1. get the cure
        2. destroy the vials
    - we accept, we get some climbing gear
    - Elro is going to quarantine the town
- autobots, rollout!
- We leave @ 8:30 am and take 4 hours to reach the peak
- Eseld and Xeru feel a magical disturbance
- We reach an obelisk with an 'igni' sign and is radiating heat with an orange hue
- Behind the obelisk, are the ruins of Iselkross
- The obelisk:
    - Xeru approaches the obelisk, it starts to hum and his medallian starts to glow
    - Eseld can 'hear' the humming say: 'City of frost, city of storm, city of flesh and broken bone'
    - The obelisk glows and emits chaos energy? Eseld gains 1 1st level and 1 2nd level spell slots
    - Quill says he can 'read' the history of the place, a lot of chaos energy entered the world and Iselkross was covered in a sphere of fire which is why it melted
- Iselkross:
    - The entrance was concealed, but we find it
    - It says 'Iselkross', it is frozen shut
    - Okami casts 'igni' and the ice melts
    - On the door, there is some elvish "you can catch me, but you can't throw me, if you catch me, i make your life miserable"
    - Eseld says 'the common cold', the door opens
    - there is a set of stairs downwards, which was only visible to Witcher senses
    - a sign in elvish: 'warning, disease research lab | decontamination is strictly advised'
    - we go down and enter a hallway
    - there are more warning signs on the right wall
    - the witchers can hear a growling noise
    - there are 7 'icy zombies', battle begins and we kill them all
    - One of the zombies has a ring w/ the inscription 'to my light and darkness'
    - They were once humans (against the elves in the war) and were experimented on by the elves
    - The accident froze them but then the conjunction energy animated them
    - Okami talks to quill through Xeru
    - Xeru is kinda crazy
    - There is a door named 'main laboratory' it is heavy, heavier than steel
    - There is a ring already in the door in a sort-of 'key-hole', there is also another ring-sized hole to the next
