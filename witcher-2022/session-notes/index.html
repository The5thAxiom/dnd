<li>nimrod smelt a <a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Nekker">nekker</a>’s smell</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Nimrod follows the sword’s smell trail and we reach a small cave.</li>
<li>There’s a small child in the cave with a wooden sword who apparently killed a nekker.</li>
<li>Jon tells us that the nekkers just wanted to play with them.</li>
<li>Back in Jon’s locality, his friend’s mother tells us that kraskald sent jon out cause he was drinking (moonshine, a strong liqour so he might be drinking to forget)</li>
<li>talkin’ to misa/nisa:

<li>Going to Urgon’s house:
<ul>
<li>1 story log cabin @ the end of the villiage</li>
<li>there is a guard at the front door</li>
<li>we enter the house</li>
<li>mantle has a beast w/ white horns (leshen? skull)</li>

<li>how to sell (garreth Vee’s elven antiquity hustling guide)</li>
<li>book on notebandhi:

<li>footprints:

<li>from the front door, exit through the back door</li>
<li>damp (one day of rain)</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the party splits
<ul>
<li>nimrod, eregon: footprints then Tulgi’s</li>
<li>okami, eseld, quartzite: pelc’s curiosities then Tulgi’s</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>eregon thinks but knows nothing</li>
<li>nimrod casts ‘detect poison and disease’, its not very effective!</li>
<li>team pelc’s:
<ul>
<li>we befriend a wolf named dhaniya by feeding him elven parle G (for 5 sp down from 5gp)</li>
<li>doesn’t like the witchers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>team footprints:
<ul>
<li>they reach tulgi’s house</li>
<li>she was the thief</li>
<li>she stole Urgon’s belongings and gave it to her sister (hulil)</li>
<li>hulil sent some men from her group (Scoia’tael) to pelc’s</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pelc’s:
<ul>
<li>party reunites</li>
<li>some elves are standing there (grey dots in image)</li>
<li>the shop has been smashed</li>
<li>one of the elves tells us to go away</li>
<li>they were sent by hulil</li>
<li>the tension is gone</li>
<li>they are also looking for the artefacts</li>
<li>the artefacts Tulgi stole weren’t useful (the vials were useful)</li>
<li>we go to in the other room (purple in the image):
<ul>
<li>its a bedroom</li>
<li>single bed</li>
<li>there is an ice statue of verla pelc(elf)(store owner) there</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>verla is frozen, just like Urgon</li>
<li>i bluff about killing a member of the eternal flame and gain the main elf’s respect</li>
<li>eregon says there is grave danger:
<ul>
<li>any person exposed to these artefacts is in danger</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the blue vials are sus (cue amogus theme)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the elves take them to croaker cave (scoia’tael’s hideout):
<ul>
<li>there are pools mirky water created by melting snow with giant frogs inside</li>
<li>there is a giant snow frog (called old croaker)</li>
<li>we enter hulil’s place:
<ul>
<li>next to her is an elf called raegren</li>
<li>she also has blue veins</li>
<li>she says:
<ul>
<li>the blue vials are a key to this</li>
<li>she points to a (not her) chest</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the chest has the (cracked) blue vials
<ul>
<li>the vial has blue spores which are cracked and leaking</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h1 id="20220712--session-4">20220712 | Session 4</h1><ul>
<li>in Hulil’s room @ Croaker Cave:
<ul>
<li>in the box:
-scroll case - 15gp
<ul>
<li>jade statuette - 25gp</li>
<li>quiver 6x +1 arrows</li>
<li>silver ring + jasper stone - 15gp</li>
<li>pelc’s curiosities receipt</li>
<li>another recepit: hulil sold vials to Irven (has hubby and daughter)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We learn that teafling only live in fairbank villiage</li>
<li>Irven’s daughter liked how the vials glowed.</li>
<li>Arcana check on vials:
<ul>
<li>not natural</li>
<li>magical aura</li>
<li>no idea about the type of magic</li>
<li>Elro asked many quacks (religious healers) and none of their spells worked on the vials</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We take two vials and keep them in Nimrod’s alms box.</li>
<li>Okami is good at feeding bats to the toads.</li>
<li>Eseld tries to feed Dhaniya a bat, but Dhaniya doesn’t like it.</li>
<li>Okami uses axie to make him eat it. Quartzite throws a bat at Okami.</li>
<li>We roll initiative:
<ul>
<li>Okami</li>
<li>Eregon</li>
<li>Nimrod</li>
<li>Regular Frog</li>
<li>Old Croaker</li>
<li>Quartzite</li>
<li>Dhaniya</li>
<li>Eseld</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Okami runs out of the cave, the frogs calm down.</li>
<li>Everyone leaves, Okami is outside</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We make Okami pay 5gp for elven (actual) parle G, Dhaniya likes him.</li>
<li>We tell Elro everything, he takes the vials to study them and asks us to wait till the morning.</li>
<li>I ask a Gnome lady to hook me up with a collar for my doggie.</li>
<li>We eat and go sleep (long rest).</li>
</ul><h1 id="20220723--session-5">20220723 | Session 5</h1><ul>
<li>@ the Tavern:
<ul>
<li>Eseld’s vision:
<ul>
<li>sees a mountain</li>
<li>orange light behind the mountain</li>
<li>there is a humming noise</li>
<li>it gets louder and he wakes up</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Elro is paying for it all</li>
<li>Xeru, another witcher was also asked by Elro to help him</li>
<li>The Gnomish tavern keeper gives me a collar and a leash</li>
<li>I put the leash in the bag</li>
<li>Okami thinks the collar is kinky (for some FUCKING reason)</li>
<li>Xeru meets the party</li>
<li>Nimrod doesn’t like being surrounded by witchers (nimrod ke 2 aage witcher, nimrod ke 2 peeche witcher, aage witcher, peeche witcher, bolo kitne witcher?)</li>
<li>Elro rushes in, approaches us and talks to us:
<ul>
<li>Before the war and the conjuction, an old witcher came to Elro to ask about the Iselkross ruins</li>
<li>but the witcher had to go and help his student (vesemir (okami is looking for him))</li>
<li>Back then, Iselkross was under a glacier.</li>
<li>during the conjunction, there was a bright orange glow</li>
<li>they thought monsters were gonna appear but the didn’t</li>
<li>Recently, Urgon found out that the glacier had melted</li>
<li>then Urgon went to Iselkross on his own and got artefacts</li>
<li>Iselkross used to be an elven militiary research bunker</li>
<li>there had been an accident in Iselkross and no one heard from it</li>
<li>thus, the vials were military research, prolly something called ‘Frigid Woe’</li>
<li>it can’t be detected, removed or anything using a spell</li>
<li>they prolly had a cure (probably still in Iselkross)</li>
<li>Elro takes a vial and puts it over a flame, the contents turn black</li>
<li>the spores’ weakness is Fire!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>what we need to do:
<ol>
<li>get the cure</li>
<li>destroy the vials</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>we accept, we get some climbing gear</li>
<li>Elro is going to quarantine the town</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>autobots, rollout!</li>
<li>We leave @ 8:30 am and take 4 hours to reach the peak</li>
<li>Eseld and Xeru feel a magical disturbance</li>
<li>We reach an obelisk with an ‘igni’ sign and is radiating heat with an orange hue</li>
<li>Behind the obelisk, are the ruins of Iselkross</li>
<li>The obelisk:
<ul>
<li>Xeru approaches the obelisk, it starts to hum and his medallian starts to glow</li>
<li>Eseld can ‘hear’ the humming say: ‘City of frost, city of storm, city of flesh and broken bone’</li>
<li>The obelisk glows and emits chaos energy? Eseld gains 1 1st level and 1 2nd level spell slots</li>
<li>Quill says he can ‘read’ the history of the place, a lot of chaos energy entered the world and Iselkross was covered in a sphere of fire which is why it melted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Iselkross:
<ul>
<li>The entrance was concealed, but we find it</li>
<li>It says ‘Iselkross’, it is frozen shut</li>
<li>Okami casts ‘igni’ and the ice melts</li>
<li>On the door, there is some elvish “you can catch me, but you can’t throw me, if you catch me, i make your life miserable”</li>
<li>Eseld says ‘the common cold’, the door opens</li>
<li>there is a set of stairs downwards, which was only visible to Witcher senses</li>
<li>a sign in elvish: ‘warning, disease research lab | decontamination is strictly advised’</li>
<li>we go down and enter a hallway</li>
<li>there are more warning signs on the right wall</li>
<li>the witchers can hear a growling noise</li>
<li>there are 7 ‘icy zombies’, battle begins and we kill them all</li>
<li>One of the zombies has a ring w/ the inscription ‘to my light and darkness’</li>
<li>They were once humans (against the elves in the war) and were experimented on by the elves</li>
<li>The accident froze them but then the conjunction energy animated them</li>
<li>Okami talks to quill through Xeru</li>
<li>Xeru is kinda crazy</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h2 id="20220807--session-6--pati-patni-aur-frigid-woe">20220807 | Session 6 | Pati-Patni aur Frigid Woe</h2><ul>
<li>There is a door named ‘main laboratory’ it is heavy, heavier than steel</li>
<li>There is a ring already in the door in a sort-of ‘key-hole’, there is also another ring-sized hole to the next</li>
<li>ring inscription: ‘my light in darkness’</li>
<li>The zombies were all human wearing prisoner garb</li>
<li>Eseld mage hands the ring onto the hole</li>
<li>The door slowly opens and retreats into the wall</li>
<li>There is a hallway w/ a small wooden door at the end and an alcove to the left</li>
<li>Nimrod uses divine sense and says that the hallway is empty.</li>
<li>There is a door marked ‘disease storage’</li>
<li>The door ahead says “Ferol Isel’s Lab”</li>
<li>Xeru opens the door</li>
<li>Isel’s Lab:
<ul>
<li>The walls have shelves with random shit</li>
<li>an armed humanoid moves adjusting shit</li>
<li>on the opposite corner, there are blue vials</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Wight points at us and asks who are we</li>
<li>The wight used to be an elven woman</li>
<li>Eseld tries to BS her about the elven race being in danger and claims to be ‘Solaro’</li>
<li>Ferol has an identical ring</li>
<li>Quartzite talks to her, gets inspired.</li>
<li>She attacks us:
<ul>
<li>An icicle falls and becomes a flying thing and attacks some of us</li>
<li>Necrotic damage does half damage to a Wight :( #fuckTheDM</li>
<li>Okami hits her with a frigid woe tipped arrow but she takes it</li>
<li>Another ice thingy comes out</li>
<li>Okami slashes her limbs off</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h2 id="20220813--session-7">20220813 | Session 7</h2><ul>
<li>She says the cure is in the ‘disease storage’ room or in the storage above</li>
<li>We take a key and her ring</li>
<li>We go to the disease storage</li>
<li>idk what happened</li>
<li>She snaps a finger and all the vials break, chemicals cover her and passes away (the party is safe)</li>
<li>We take the cure</li>
<li>We bring the remaining vials of Frigid Woe with us.</li>
<li>We arrive at the village by 5</li>
<li>Elro introduces us to two soldiers with black feathers on their helmets</li>
<li>Captain Dradier of the Nilfgardian army greets us</li>
<li>He doesn’t intend to destroy the vials</li>
<li>Quartzite distracts the captian</li>
<li>The party decides to just fucking burn the vials and be done with it.</li>
<li>The witchers start burning the vials</li>
<li>Frigid woe is gone</li>
<li>Dradier tries to arrest us</li>
<li>Battle starts:
<ul>
<li>Eregon tries to calm everyone</li>
<li>But Okami just attacks, the Captian hits Okami</li>
<li>Nimrod goes ‘only I have the right to kill Okami’ and also attacks the Captian</li>
<li>Xeru kills the Captian</li>
<li>We kill the other 2 soldiers as well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Elro’s glassblades have rounded up the others</li>
<li>We discuss what Elro will tell the Nilfgardian’s when they ask about the captain.</li>
<li>We return to the tavern</li>
<li>We get 50 gp each?</li>
</ul><h2 id="20221015--session-8">20221015 | Session 8</h2><ul>
<li>Okami sharts.</li>
<li>Okami finds a strange guy, called Professor Nyct.</li>
<li>He buys everyone some <em>expensive</em> wine.</li>
<li>Okami successfully gets a woman, and we hear ‘noises’.</li>
<li>Xeru fixes a mandolin to drown out the voices.</li>
<li>We all pass out in the tavern.</li>
