<li>Gundren left a note, ‘meet me in Phandalen’ (couple of days East).</li>
<li>Gundern has gone ahead to a town and we will follow with supplies. We need to deliver the wagon to a post.</li>
<li>Gundren and his brothers had found something ‘good’.</li>
<li>We are escorted by ‘Sildar’.</li>
<li>We are entering dangerous territory.</li>
<li>Ebira and HerbAxe are driving the wagon.s</li>
<li>The wagon has (about 100gp of value):
<ul>
<li>Mining supplies</li>
<li>Food:
<ul>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Salted pork</li>
<li>Ale</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shovels and stuff</li>
<li>5 Lanterns with oil</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We find 2 dead horses, with black feathered arrows poking out.</li>
<li>HerbAxe find Gundren and brother’s stamps. The saddles were empty and there is an empty map case.</li>
<li>I hear a whistling sound (not a bird call).</li>
<li>None of us notice but arrows start flying at us.</li>
<li>There are small goblins staring at us from the thickets.</li>
<li>Battle and inititaive:
<ul>
<li>Goblin 1</li>
<li>Goblin 2</li>
<li>Erxhalim</li>
<li>HerbAxe</li>
<li>Ebira</li>
<li>Goblin 3</li>
<li>Goblin 4</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We capture goblin 4, I feed him a herb, he is out cold.</li>
<li>Erxhalim finds the goblin’s trail. About a dozen goblins were here, 2 bodies were taken from here.</li>
<li>The goblin’s boss is called ‘Clarg’. Very annoying.</li>
<li>We hide the wagon, also take some oil. HerbAxe takes a shot of ale.</li>
<li>Boblin is on a leash, we go on the trail.</li>
<li>There is a snare.</li>
<li>Erxhalim hides in the thickets and follows us.</li>
<li>We find a large cave (5 miles from the ambush).</li>
<li>There is a shallow stream comes out of the cave, there is a narrow path going into the cave (opposite side of the river).</li>
<li>Erxhalim tries to sneak in and assassin’s creeds 2 goblins.</li>
<li>The path splits, Erxhalim goes straight ahead, HerbAxe and Ebira go on the fork, where there is a barking dog.</li>
<li>Erxhalim:
<ul>
<li>There is a bridge and shit.</li>
<li>He stealth kills a goblin (morbius) and he falls in the stream and there is a splash but no one finds out.</li>
<li>He goes ahead, through some passages.</li>
<li>He finds Sildar, bound. The goblins appear to wanting to be eating him. The goblin boss is also there.</li>
<li>He one-shots the goblin boss. The others know he’s there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The others:
<ul>
<li>Find a small chamber, smelling of dirty fir. There are three chained wolves. I calm all of them, unchain one and he goes away.</li>
<li>We follow a draft of wind, towards where boblin says his boss is but can’t climb.</li>
<li>We trace our steps, find Erxhalim’s tracks. We hear a cry of surprise.</li>
<li>We see Erxhalim who just shot an arrow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h2 id="20220803">20220803</h2><ul>
<li>The goblins think that Erxhalim is the wind warrior prophecy.</li>
<li>We make boblin the king.</li>
<li>We decide to free Sildar and fight clarg (the real boss)</li>
<li>Sildar is wearing an armor with the symbol of the “Lord’s alliegance”</li>
<li>Sildar takes Claw’s (the guy who died) shortsword and uses some of his ointment.</li>
<li>We go towards the bridge.</li>
<li>We’re planning but clarg arrives and herbaxe asks him about his dictionary.</li>
<li>Herbaxe tries to use ice knife on him.
<ul>
<li>Battle happens:</li>
<li>HerbAxe gets badly wounded.</li>
<li>Boblin saves him</li>
<li>HerbAxe ice knifed Clarg.</li>
<li>Erxhalim is down.</li>
<li>HerbAxe kills Clarg with a Shillelagh’d club.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HerbAxe takes his dictionary (book of words)</li>
<li>Sildar says they took Rockseeker to the actual goblin king.</li>
<li>We get a lot of loot.</li>
<li>HerbAxe takes Clarg’s skull.</li>
<li>‘The black spider was paying the dwarfs to send Gundren to the king grol’</li>
<li>We head to Phandalen</li>
<li>We talk to Sildar:
<ul>
<li>Sildar was heading to inquire about Iarno Alvrek.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We all level up.</li>
</ul><h2 id="20220809">20220809</h2><ul>
<li>On the way to Phandalen
<ul>
<li>We see the town</li>
<li>There are ruins around the new buildings (the town used to be bigger)</li>
<li>Sildar is much more relaxed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We go to ‘StoneHill Inn’:
<ul>
<li>There is a human innkeeper, Trilena (Erxhalim has slept with her before).</li>
<li>She has a husband named Toblin.</li>
<li>Erxhalim gets a drink</li>
<li>We all go to our rooms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The next day, we overhear:
<ul>
<li>An old dwarf farmer called Narth, a gossipy half-elf barmaid called Elsa.</li>
<li>Erxhalim tries to flirt with her</li>
<li>There is tiefling bard, Chorus, playing music</li>
<li>Narth is talking about:
<ul>
<li>Sister gara-el (oversees the shrine of luck) recently left town for a few days, when she returned, she had a scar and was exhausted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Elsa tells us about the town:
<ul>
<li>Daran Edermath, an orchard keeper is a former adventurer</li>
<li>Try to stay clear of the red brands (a gang which controls Phandalen and extorts people, led by a mysterious figure known as Glass Taff)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A miner, Lanar says:
<ul>
<li>Did you hear that at the east end of the Tribor trail, there were some orc raiders</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>James Silgod, a gnomish prospector says:
<ul>
<li>There were goblins on tribor trail attacking trading parties</li>
<li>He’d pay 10 gold pieces whoever will kill them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He was supposed to find him</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talking to Trilena:
<ul>
<li>Thel dendrar, the local woodcarver stood up to the red brands, they beat him up and he is bed ridden.</li>
<li>The others took his stuff and kidnapped his family</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The redbrands frequent the ‘sleeping giant’ taphouse</li>
<li>A kid says another kid found a secret tunnel but the red brands caught him.</li>
<li>The red brands do every bussines except mining cause they don’t want trouble with Halia Faunten. She is the leader of the miner’s exchange.</li>
<li>Sildar says he will help with the red brands if we help him with Iarno</li>
<li>We head to the Edermath orchard:
<ul>
<li>We see a fit (;)), silver-haired half-elf with an ornamental sword tending to the orchards</li>
<li>HerbAxe takes 4 peaches and 4 apples, goes to the top of the tree and surveys the area</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We go to his cottege:
<ul>
<li>He was in ‘the order of the gauntlet’</li>
<li>The order fights against the assassin’s guild (Erxhalim’s group)</li>
<li>We tell him why we need our help</li>
<li>He already knows sildar</li>
<li>He sent them some fruit and knows that their secret base is in Tresendar Manor</li>
<li>He tells us that many prospectors were chased by undead near old owl’s well and someone is digging around there (dangerous magic could be around)</li>
<li>The ruins are of an ancient magical empire</li>
<li>Halia runs the miner’s guild, isn’t someone you want to watch your back (you need to promise her that there’s a reward and she won’t let you go)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We go to give the cart’s goods to the destination (barthen’s):
<ul>
<li>Barthen and Gundren were trying to find the ‘Lost Mines of Phandelver’</li>
<li>More than 500 years ago, dwarves and gnomes made an agreement (Phandelver’s pact)</li>
<li>They would gain access to a mine (wave echo cave), with great wealth and magical power</li>
<li>Human spellcaster used that energy to create the ‘Forge of Spells’, where magic items can be created</li>
<li>This made Phandalen rich, but then Orc attacked and the cave was lost</li>
<li>We then Barthen about what happened to Gundren</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We go to ‘Lionshield Coster’:
<ul>
<li>It is a logistics company</li>
<li>We return the stuff we stole</li>
<li>We enquire about Halia</li>
<li>Erxhalim successfully asks the girl at the shop out!</li>
<li>The party buys some adventuring gear.</li>
<li>HerbAxe gets a Staff of the Python (Nagina!).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We head to The Miner’s Exchange:
<ul>
<li>There are two people dressed in red, outside the building</li>
<li>He says the boss says no one can meet Halia</li>
<li>These are the red bandits:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We turn around and head to Tresendar manner
<ul>
<li>We see the sleeping giant taphouse</li>
<li>I try to go in, Ebira stops me, the commotion causes some red brands to come out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We fight</li>
<li>We kill 3, one surrenders</li>
<li>We wrap him in Nagina and take him aside to interrogate him.</li>
</ul>
