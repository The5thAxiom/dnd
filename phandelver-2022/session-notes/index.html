<li>Gundren left a note, ‘meet me in Phandalen’ (couple of days East).</li>
<li>Gundern has gone ahead to a town and we will follow with supplies. We need to deliver the wagon to a post.</li>
<li>Gundren and his brothers had found something ‘good’.</li>
<li>We are escorted by ‘Sildar’.</li>
<li>We are entering dangerous territory.</li>
<li>Ebira and HerbAxe are driving the wagon.s</li>
<li>The wagon has (about 100gp of value):
<ul>
<li>Mining supplies</li>
<li>Food:
<ul>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Salted pork</li>
<li>Ale</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shovels and stuff</li>
<li>5 Lanterns with oil</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We find 2 dead horses, with black feathered arrows poking out.</li>
<li>HerbAxe find Gundren and brother’s stamps. The saddles were empty and there is an empty map case.</li>
<li>I hear a whistling sound (not a bird call).</li>
<li>None of us notice but arrows start flying at us.</li>
<li>There are small goblins staring at us from the thickets.</li>
<li>Battle and inititaive:
<ul>
<li>Goblin 1</li>
<li>Goblin 2</li>
<li>Erxhalim</li>
<li>HerbAxe</li>
<li>Ebira</li>
<li>Goblin 3</li>
<li>Goblin 4</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We capture goblin 4, I feed him a herb, he is out cold.</li>
<li>Erxhalim finds the goblin’s trail. About a dozen goblins were here, 2 bodies were taken from here.</li>
<li>The goblin’s boss is called ‘Clarg’. Very annoying.</li>
<li>We hide the wagon, also take some oil. HerbAxe takes a shot of ale.</li>
<li>Boblin is on a leash, we go on the trail.</li>
<li>There is a snare.</li>
<li>Erxhalim hides in the thickets and follows us.</li>
<li>We find a large cave (5 miles from the ambush).</li>
<li>There is a shallow stream comes out of the cave, there is a narrow path going into the cave (opposite side of the river).</li>
<li>Erxhalim tries to sneak in and assassin’s creeds 2 goblins.</li>
<li>The path splits, Erxhalim goes straight ahead, HerbAxe and Ebira go on the fork, where there is a barking dog.</li>
<li>Erxhalim:
<ul>
<li>There is a bridge and shit.</li>
<li>He stealth kills a goblin (morbius) and he falls in the stream and there is a splash but no one finds out.</li>
<li>He goes ahead, through some passages.</li>
<li>He finds Sildar, bound. The goblins appear to wanting to be eating him. The goblin boss is also there.</li>
<li>He one-shots the goblin boss. The others know he’s there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The others:
<ul>
<li>Find a small chamber, smelling of dirty fir. There are three chained wolves. I calm all of them, unchain one and he goes away.</li>
<li>We follow a draft of wind, towards where boblin says his boss is but can’t climb.</li>
<li>We trace our steps, find Erxhalim’s tracks. We hear a cry of surprise.</li>
<li>We see Erxhalim who just shot an arrow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h2 id="20220803">20220803</h2><ul>
<li>The goblins think that Erxhalim is the wind warrior prophecy.</li>
<li>We make boblin the king.</li>
<li>We decide to free Sildar and fight clarg (the real boss)</li>
<li>Sildar is wearing an armor with the symbol of the “Lord’s alliegance”</li>
<li>Sildar takes Claw’s (the guy who died) shortsword and uses some of his ointment.</li>
<li>We go towards the bridge.</li>
<li>We’re planning but clarg arrives and herbaxe asks him about his dictionary.</li>
<li>Herbaxe tries to use ice knife on him.
<ul>
<li>Battle happens:</li>
<li>HerbAxe gets badly wounded.</li>
<li>Boblin saves him</li>
<li>HerbAxe ice knifed Clarg.</li>
<li>Erxhalim is down.</li>
<li>HerbAxe kills Clarg with a Shillelagh’d club.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HerbAxe takes his dictionary (book of words)</li>
<li>Sildar says they took Rockseeker to the actual goblin king.</li>
<li>We get a lot of loot.</li>
<li>HerbAxe takes Clarg’s skull.</li>
<li>‘The black spider was paying the dwarfs to send Gundren to the king grol’</li>
<li>We head to Phandalen</li>
<li>We talk to Sildar:
<ul>
<li>Sildar was heading to inquire about Iarno Alvrek.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We all level up.</li>
</ul><h2 id="20220809">20220809</h2><ul>
<li>On the way to Phandalen
<ul>
<li>We see the town</li>
<li>There are ruins around the new buildings (the town used to be bigger)</li>
<li>Sildar is much more relaxed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We go to ‘StoneHill Inn’:
<ul>
<li>There is a human innkeeper, Trilena (Erxhalim has slept with her before).</li>
<li>She has a husband named Toblin.</li>
<li>Erxhalim gets a drink</li>
<li>We all go to our rooms</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The next day, we overhear:
<ul>
<li>An old dwarf farmer called Narth, a gossipy half-elf barmaid called Elsa.</li>
<li>Erxhalim tries to flirt with her</li>
<li>There is tiefling bard, Chorus, playing music</li>
<li>Narth is talking about:
<ul>
<li>Sister gara-el (oversees the shrine of luck) recently left town for a few days, when she returned, she had a scar and was exhausted</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Elsa tells us about the town:
<ul>
<li>Daran Edermath, an orchard keeper is a former adventurer</li>
<li>Try to stay clear of the red brands (a gang which controls Phandalen and extorts people, led by a mysterious figure known as Glass Taff)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A miner, Lanar says:
<ul>
<li>Did you hear that at the east end of the Tribor trail, there were some orc raiders</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>James Silgod, a gnomish prospector says:
<ul>
<li>There were goblins on tribor trail attacking trading parties</li>
<li>He’d pay 10 gold pieces whoever will kill them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>He was supposed to find him</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Talking to Trilena:
<ul>
<li>Thel dendrar, the local woodcarver stood up to the red brands, they beat him up and he is bed ridden.</li>
<li>The others took his stuff and kidnapped his family</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The redbrands frequent the ‘sleeping giant’ taphouse</li>
<li>A kid says another kid found a secret tunnel but the red brands caught him.</li>
<li>The red brands do every bussines except mining cause they don’t want trouble with Halia Faunten. She is the leader of the miner’s exchange.</li>
<li>Sildar says he will help with the red brands if we help him with Iarno</li>
<li>We head to the Edermath orchard:
<ul>
<li>We see a fit (;)), silver-haired half-elf with an ornamental sword tending to the orchards</li>
<li>HerbAxe takes 4 peaches and 4 apples, goes to the top of the tree and surveys the area</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We go to his cottage:
<ul>
<li>He was in ‘the order of the gauntlet’</li>
<li>The order fights against the assassin’s guild (Erxhalim’s group)</li>
<li>We tell him why we need our help</li>
<li>He already knows sildar</li>
<li>He sent them some fruit and knows that their secret base is in Tresendar Manor</li>
<li>He tells us that many prospectors were chased by undead near old owl’s well and someone is digging around there (dangerous magic could be around)</li>
<li>The ruins are of an ancient magical empire</li>
<li>Halia runs the miner’s guild, isn’t someone you want to watch your back (you need to promise her that there’s a reward and she won’t let you go)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We go to give the cart’s goods to the destination (barthen’s):
<ul>
<li>Barthen and Gundren were trying to find the ‘Lost Mines of Phandelver’</li>
<li>More than 500 years ago, dwarves and gnomes made an agreement (Phandelver’s pact)</li>
<li>They would gain access to a mine (wave echo cave), with great wealth and magical power</li>
<li>Human spellcaster used that energy to create the ‘Forge of Spells’, where magic items can be created</li>
<li>This made Phandalen rich, but then Orc attacked and the cave was lost</li>
<li>We then Barthen about what happened to Gundren</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We go to ‘Lionshield Coster’:
<ul>
<li>It is a logistics company</li>
<li>We return the stuff we stole</li>
<li>We enquire about Halia</li>
<li>Erxhalim successfully asks the girl at the shop out!</li>
<li>The party buys some adventuring gear.</li>
<li>HerbAxe gets a Staff of the Python (Nagina!).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We head to The Miner’s Exchange:
<ul>
<li>There are two people dressed in red, outside the building</li>
<li>He says the boss says no one can meet Halia</li>
<li>These are red bandits</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We turn around and head to Tresendar manner
<ul>
<li>We see the sleeping giant taphouse</li>
<li>I try to go in, Ebira stops me, the commotion causes some red brands to come out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We fight</li>
<li>We kill 3, one surrenders</li>
<li>We wrap him in Nagina and take him aside to interrogate him.</li>
</ul><h2 id="20220907--session-8">20220907 | Session 8</h2><ul>
<li>Talking to the Red Brand guy:
<ul>
<li>HerbAxe finds out that the sleeping giant is not an actual giant.</li>
<li>The guys in front of Halia’s home were just blocking the house cause they were scared of her.</li>
<li>The Red Brands didn’t want anyone to meet Halia.</li>
<li>There are cursed magic items at the well</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We let him go but then we kill him</li>
<li>We take some Red Brand gear</li>
<li>We head back to Halia’s home</li>
<li>The townmaster is somewhat disappointed.</li>
<li>We try to fool the guards in front of Halia’s house but they recognise the gear and we start fighting:
<ul>
<li>Ebira hits one</li>
<li>HerbAxe becomes a bear and kills them both (a crit)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We enter the Miner’s Exchange</li>
<li>We meet Halia
<ul>
<li>She wants Glasstaff’s (the leader of the Red Brands) head and will give us money and access to the mines</li>
<li>She gives us info about the Red Brands</li>
<li>Glasstaff is probably at Tressendar Manor</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We take a long rest, Erxhalim has a <em>good time</em> (;)) with Linea</li>
<li>Next morning, we meet the Townmaster for a bit.</li>
<li>We head to the Sleeping Giant Taphouse
<ul>
<li>Erxhalim and HerbAxe sneak in</li>
<li>We come in from the 1st floor window</li>
<li>We see 5 guys below, HerbAxe restrains 2 of them with entangle</li>
<li>Erxhalim signals Ebira and Sildar to enter, battle:
<ul>
<li>Ebira enters and sees 2 others, he attacks one</li>
<li>Sildar takes a shot with his crossbow on the same guy</li>
<li>HerbAxe misses a fireball</li>
<li>Erxhalim shoots a restrained guy with his longbow</li>
<li>Ebira goes down</li>
<li>HerbAxe activates Nagina, she misses biting a guy</li>
<li>HerbAxe heals Ebira</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h2 id="20220913">20220913</h2><ul>
<li>The battle is going on:
<ul>
<li>Erxhalim kills a restrained guy</li>
<li>The Red Brands do a little damage to Nagina</li>
<li>HerbAxe goes down and becomes a bear, bites a guy and misses his claw attack on one.</li>
<li>Nagina kills the guy he bit</li>
<li>Erxhalim shoots a guy with his longbow, and throws his dagger of venom and kills the restrained guy</li>
<li>A Red Brand bloodies Sildar</li>
<li>Ebira kills a Red Brand and injures another</li>
<li>Nagina finishes the last guy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A guy on a carriage approaches the taphouse with a gagged Linene (Erxhalim’s date)</li>
<li>He is <em>Bearded Mamba</em>, no. 5 on the Assassin’s Guild Scoreboard (Erxhalim is no. 10)</li>
<li>Le leta hai vo hamari baaton baaton me</li>
<li>We go back to the Inn, Erxhalim is sneaking around</li>
<li>Erxhalim sneaks into Lionshield’s Coster (through the chimney)</li>
<li>He looks around, there is no proof that connects her to the Red Brands.</li>
<li>We all level up!</li>
<li>Erxhalim tells us to go to Daran’s House</li>
</ul><h1 id="20220916">20220916</h1><ul>
<li>Daran’s house:
<ul>
<li>We meet ‘Yuga Yandex Yenki’ the Barbarian.</li>
<li>We decide to head to the ‘undead well’</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We overhear some people in the Smithy talking about how Erxhalim has been promoted to number 9.</li>
<li>We climb a hill and see ruins in the valley.</li>
<li>There are about 20 zombies</li>
<li>We battle:
<ul>
<li>We are in a formation, with Nagina, Ebira and Yuga at the front, HerbAxe behind them and Erxhalim on top of the hill.</li>
<li>We kill some zombies</li>
<li>HerbAxe is shooting his shortbow, the big guys are using their meele weapons, Erxhalim is sniping them from the hill and Nagina is being Nagina and we defeat that group.</li>
<li>HerbAxe snipes two with an ice knife.</li>
<li>We battle some more zombies.</li>
<li>Nagina gets bloodied :(</li>
<li>We clear the zone</li>
<li>Ebira kills a single hiding zombie.</li>
<li>We find another group</li>
<li>Nagina squeezes a zombie to death</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We kill the zombies and approach the well and look in</li>
</ul><h1 id="20220921">20220921</h1><ul>
<li>There is a staircase inside, spiralling downwards.</li>
<li>We hear strange sounds from inside it</li>
<li>We can see a pile of bones in there.</li>
<li>We decide to go in.</li>
<li>We kill 4 more zombies and find Kilarash and his robo dog, Vangaurd.</li>
<li>We talk a bit and introduce ourselves.</li>
<li>The well is connected to the Phandelver mines.</li>
<li>We know that the magic may be connected to the zombies and the magic is in the well/mines.</li>
<li>We light the cavern a bit, and we see its a wide room and there is also a tunnel.</li>
<li>The tunnel curves and there is a large cavern on the other side.</li>
<li>There are 15 zombies, stalactites, stalagmites, a pool of water and a green glowing rock.</li>
<li>There is a fallen skeleton in heavy armour at the base of the rock.</li>
<li>The cavern ceiling is being held up by some support beams.</li>
<li>Kilarash thinks this was the entry point to the mines.</li>
<li>Our plan: Kilarash will freeze the pool, then we all make ranged attacks on them.</li>
<li>Battle:
<ul>
<li>We hit some zombies</li>
<li>7 of them break out of the ice</li>
<li>Erxhalim kills 2</li>
<li>Ebira crits and smites and does <code>59</code> total damage and kills the remaining 5</li>
<li>There are 7 remaining zombies in the cavern.</li>
</ul>
</li>
