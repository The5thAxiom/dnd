<li>Gundren left a note, ‘meet me in Phandalen’ (couple of days East).</li>
<li>Gundern has gone ahead to a town and we will follow with supplies. We need to deliver the wagon to a post.</li>
<li>Gundren and his brothers had found something ‘good’.</li>
<li>We are escorted by ‘Sildar’.</li>
<li>We are entering dangerous territory.</li>
<li>Ebira and HerbAxe are driving the wagon.s</li>
<li>The wagon has (about 100gp of value):
<ul>
<li>Mining supplies</li>
<li>Food:
<ul>
<li>Flour</li>
<li>Salted pork</li>
<li>Ale</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shovels and stuff</li>
<li>5 Lanterns with oil</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We find 2 dead horses, with black feathered arrows poking out.</li>
<li>HerbAxe find Gundren and brother’s stamps. The saddles were empty and there is an empty map case.</li>
<li>I hear a whistling sound (not a bird call).</li>
<li>None of us notice but arrows start flying at us.</li>
<li>There are small goblins staring at us from the thickets.</li>
<li>Battle and inititaive:
<ul>
<li>Goblin 1</li>
<li>Goblin 2</li>
<li>Erxhalim</li>
<li>HerbAxe</li>
<li>Ebira</li>
<li>Goblin 3</li>
<li>Goblin 4</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We capture goblin 4, I feed him a herb, he is out cold.</li>
<li>Erxhalim finds the goblin’s trail. About a dozen goblins were here, 2 bodies were taken from here.</li>
<li>The goblin’s boss is called ‘clard’. Very annoying.</li>
<li>We hide the wagon, also take some oil. HerbAxe takes a shot of ale.</li>
<li>Boblin is on a leash, we go on the trail.</li>
<li>There is a snare.</li>
<li>Erxhalim hides in the thickets and follows us.</li>
<li>We find a large cave (5 miles from the ambush).</li>
<li>There is a shallow stream comes out of the cave, there is a narrow path going into the cave (opposite side of the river).</li>
<li>Erxhalim tries to sneak in and assassin’s creeds 2 goblins.</li>
<li>The path splits, Erxhalim goes straight ahead, HerbAxe and Ebira go on the fork, where there is a barking dog.</li>
<li>Erxhalim:
<ul>
<li>There is a bridge and shit.</li>
<li>He stealth kills a goblin (morbius) and he falls in the stream and there is a splash but no one finds out.</li>
<li>He goes ahead, through some passages.</li>
<li>He finds Sildar, bound. The goblins appear to wanting to be eating him. The goblin boss is also there.</li>
<li>He one-shots the goblin boss. The others know he’s there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The others:
<ul>
<li>Find a small chamber, smelling of dirty fir. There are three chained wolves. I calm all of them, unchain one and he goes away.</li>
<li>We follow a draft of wind, towards where boblin says his boss is but can’t climb.</li>
<li>We trace our steps, find Erxhalim’s tracks. We hear a cry of surprise.</li>
<li>We see Erxhalim who just shot an arrow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
